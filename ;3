[I MIGHT UPDATE THIS MESSAGE FROM TIME TO TIME!]

Hey, I'm Softy. 
If your reading this, you either are curious about my thoughts or where asked to read this, (which is more likely to be the case)

If your someone I typically talk to, you may describe me as "happy"
Though, I may want you to think this, it is not the case.

I suffer from a very bad depression, and due to my bipolar, its very hard to tell, though I am good at masking my emotions.

I live with an abusive parent, and i lack the ability of freedom.
basic things like going outside, to other things like getting a job, are restricted.

I am autistic and it makes it very difficult for me to make friends, so online is where my life is.
I can be anything. From a therapist, to someone you flirt to, to a friend to chat with, or someone you ask advice for.
I take care of people more then myself, despite not even getting a similar response back.

I have ADHD and I'm someone who tends to self harm, so i tend to do without thinking. This means that the result of me cutting with a blade in my hand has no guarantee whether or not the cut is life threatening, but rather the chance of me noticing what i am doing, and processing the information before its too late. This also doesn't guarantee whether or not I stop, because there may be a time where I actually do want to do it, therefor it would be intentional.
